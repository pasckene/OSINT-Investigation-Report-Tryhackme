# OHSINT – TryHackMe OSINT Investigation

**A Structured OSINT Walkthrough Demonstrating Practical Reconnaissance Skills**

This repository documents my investigation process for the **OhSINT challenge** from TryHackMe. The objective of this lab was to gather intelligence using only publicly available sources — applying structured OSINT methodology without direct interaction or exploitation.

---

## Executive Summary

The OhSINT challenge simulates a real-world passive reconnaissance scenario. Starting with a single image file, I leveraged metadata analysis, social media correlation, public repository inspection, Wi-Fi intelligence databases, and web source code review to uncover multiple pieces of sensitive information about a target.

This project highlights:

* Structured investigative methodology
* Practical OSINT tool usage
* Cross-platform intelligence correlation
* Identification of exposed sensitive information
* Clear documentation of findings

---

## Core Skills Demonstrated

* Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)
* Metadata Analysis
* Social Media Profiling
* GitHub Reconnaissance
* Wi-Fi Infrastructure Enumeration
* Source Code Inspection
* Digital Footprint Mapping
* Analytical Thinking & Correlation

# Investigation Methodology

## 1️⃣ Initial Artifact Analysis

The challenge provided a single image file.

First step: Extract metadata.

### Tool Used

**ExifTool**

```bash
exiftool image.jpg
```

### Key Findings

* GPS Coordinates embedded
* Copyright tag: **OWoodflint**

This immediately provided both a potential identity and geolocation lead.

---

## 2️⃣ Identity Correlation

A search for the discovered username revealed accounts on:

* GitHub
* X
* WordPress

This enabled cross-platform digital footprint analysis.

---

## 3️⃣ Social Media Analysis

On the subject’s X profile:

* Avatar identified → **Cat**

* A publicly posted BSSID was discovered:

```
B4:5D:50:AA:86:41
```

This introduced network-level reconnaissance into the investigation.

## 4️⃣ Wi-Fi Intelligence Enumeration

Using WiGLE, I queried the BSSID.

### Process:

1. Logged into WiGLE
2. Entered the BSSID
3. Zoomed into London (based on GitHub profile clue)
4. Narrowed the map to street-level

### Result:

**SSID: UnileverWiFi**

## 5️⃣ Repository Investigation

While reviewing public repositories on GitHub:

* A personal email address was located within a README file
* Location listed: **London**


![GitHub Profile](images/githubdata.png)

This reinforces how public code repositories can unintentionally expose personally identifiable information (PII).

---

## 6️⃣ Blog Intelligence Gathering

The subject’s WordPress blog revealed:

* Holiday location → **New York**

Personal blogging platforms often provide contextual behavioral intelligence.

---

## 7️⃣ Source Code Inspection

Final stage: Review of the blog’s page source.

Within the HTML ...................source, a plaintext string was discovered:

```text
pennYDr0pper.!
```

This highlights the importance of secure development practices and proper credential management.

# Security Lessons Identified

This lab reinforces several real-world cybersecurity concerns:

* Metadata can unintentionally expose identity and location
* Public repositories may leak sensitive data
* Social media posts can expose infrastructure details
* Blog source code may contain hidden credentials
* Poor operational security (OPSEC) creates aggregation risk

Even when individual data points seem harmless, correlation can reveal significant exposure.
